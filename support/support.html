    Open-source software is free of licensing fees. Furthermore, it is easy to adapt and enhance with new features.
    Nevertheless, using open-source frameworks is not free. Like in closed-source software, not everybody is
    an expert on every framework. The total cost of ownership includes training, adoption, enhancement
    and maintenance of a framework. It might take significantly more time for somebody new to the project
    to extend a certain feature than for a person who is familiar with the framework.
    Furthermore, software has to be maintained. Even if this can be done literally by everybody for
