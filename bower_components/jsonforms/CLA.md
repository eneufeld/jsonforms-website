Thank you for your interest in the project “JSONForms” managed by EclipseSource München GmbH ("EclipseSource"). In order for You (as defined below) to make intellectual property Contributions (as defined below) now or in the future to the JSONForms project, You must agree to this Contributor License Agreement ("CLA"). If You have any questions about this agreement, licensing, or anything related to intellectual property at EclipseSource, please send an email to jsonforms-cla@eclipsesource.com.

Please read this CLA carefully before accepting its terms. By accepting the CLA, You are agreeing to be bound by its terms. 

As used in this CLA:

* (i) “You" (or "Your") shall mean the entity that is making this Agreement with EclipseSource;
* (ii)"Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is submitted by You to EclipseSource for inclusion in, or documentation of, the JSONForms project; and 
* (iii) “Submit” (or “Submitted”) means any form of communication sent to EclipseSource (e.g. the content You post on electronic mailing lists, forums, content management systems, source code control systems, code review systems, issue tracking systems, etc. that are used by EclipseSource).

This agreement applies to all Contributions You submit or You have already submitted to the JSONForms project.

This CLA, and the license(s) associated with the JSONForms project You are contributing to, provides a license to Your Contributions to EclipseSource and downstream consumers, but You still own Your Contributions, and except for the licenses provided for in this CLA, You reserve all right, title and interest in Your Contributions.

EclipseSource requires that each Contribution You Submit now or in the future to comply with the following four commitments.

1. You will only Submit Contributions where You have authored 100% of the content.
2. You will only Submit Contributions to which You have the necessary rights. This means that if You are employed You have received the necessary permissions from Your employer to make the Contributions.
3. Whatever content You Contribute will be provided under the license(s) associated with the JSONForms project. Whatever content You Contribute may also be provided under any open-source license which is or will be approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI). This specifically includes but is not limited to the following licenses: Apache License 2.0, BSD 2/3 License, MIT License and Eclipse Public License v1.0.
4. You understand and agree that the JSONForms project and Your contributions are public, and that a record of the contribution (including all personal information You submit with it, including Your sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with the license(s) involved.

You will promptly notify EclipseSource if You become aware of any facts or circumstances that would make these commitments inaccurate in any way. To do so, please send an email to jsonforms-cla@eclipsesource.com.
